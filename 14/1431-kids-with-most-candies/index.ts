  Example 1:
  ------------------------
  Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
  Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
  Explanation:
    Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids.
    Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.
    Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids.
    Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies.
    Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.

  Example 2:
  ------------------------
  Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
  Output: [true,false,false,false,false]
  Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra candy.

  Example 3:
  ------------------------
  Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
  Output: [true,false,true]

  Constraints:
  ------------------------
  * 2 <= candies.length <= 100
  * 1 <= candies[i] <= 100
  * 1 <= extraCandies <= 50
