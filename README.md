# leetcode-ts

All solved leetcode problems. (WIP)

Starting on the free ones.

Problems are done in TypeScript if possible, otherwise JavaScript.

## Structure

Problems are grouped into folders based on the first 2 digits and named based on the problem url (e.g. problem 21 "Merge two sorted lists" is in `00/21-merge-two-sorted-lists/`).

General utilities are in the `util` folder and are copied (and often modified) into solutions that use them.

Idea from https://github.com/tsholmes/leetcode-go
